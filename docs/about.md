This project showcases the use of [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) to create a text-focused site with a table of contents and full-text search. You can view the [source for this site on GitHub](https://github.com/WebOrigami/cherokee-myths) or [remix the project on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/WebOrigami/cherokee-myths).

The featured stories come from [Myths of the Cherokee](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45634) by James Mooney, first published in 1900, via [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). This sample content was selected because it's free, interesting, and deserves to be better known. Like all Native American ethnographies conducted by outsiders long ago, the material is flawed. Nevertheless, reviews of this text on sites such as Amazon and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1316509.Myths_of_the_Cherokee), including reviews from people claiming Cherokee ancestry, are generally positive. If you have reason to believe a myth here should be corrected or removed, please [file an issue](https://github.com/WebOrigami/cherokee-myths/issues).

See the official [Cherokee Nation](https://www.cherokee.org/) site for information about the Cherokee people today.

Two hunters camping in the woods were preparing supper one night when a Katydid began singing near them. One of them said sneeringly, “_Kû!_ It sings and don’t know that it will die before the season ends.” The Katydid answered: “_Kû! niwĭ_ (onomatope); O, so you say; but you need not boast. You will die before to-morrow night.” The next day they were surprised by the enemy and the hunter who had sneered at the Katydid was killed.

## About this project

This project showcases the use of [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) to create a documentation site or other text-focused site. The featured content comes from [Myths of the Cherokee](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45634) by James Mooney via [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). First published in 1900, _Myths_ is now in the public domain.

This sample content was selected because it's free, interesting, and deserves to be better known. As with any Native American ethnographies conducted by outsiders, the material is surely flawed. That said, reviews of this text on sites such as Amazon and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1316509.Myths_of_the_Cherokee), including reviews from people claiming Cherokee ancestry, are generally positive. If you have reason to believe a myth here should be corrected or removed, please file an issue.

For more information about the Cherokee people today, see the official [Cherokee Nation](https://www.cherokee.org/) site.

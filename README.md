This project showcases the use of [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) to create a documentation site or other text-focused site. The featured content comes from [Myths of the Cherokee](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45634) by James Mooney, first published in 1900, via [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

This sample content was selected because it's free, interesting, and deserves to be better known. Like all Native American ethnographies conducted by outsiders long ago, the material is flawed. Nevertheless, reviews of this text on sites such as Amazon and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1316509.Myths_of_the_Cherokee), including reviews from people claiming Cherokee ancestry, are generally positive. If you have reason to believe a myth here should be corrected or removed, please file an issue.

See the official [Cherokee Nation](https://www.cherokee.org/) site for information about the Cherokee people today.

# Web Origami sample documentation project

This project showcases the use of [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) to create a documentation site or other text-focused site.

The project's sample content comes from [Myths of the Cherokee](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45634) by James Mooney via [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). First published in 1900, _Myths_ is now in the public domain. This sample content was selected because it's free, interesting, and contains stories that deserve to be better known.

As with any Native American ethnographies conducted by outsiders, the material is surely flawed. That said, reviews of this text on sites such as Amazon and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1316509.Myths_of_the_Cherokee) are generally positive. If you have reason to believe a specific myth here (or the entire collection) should be removed, please file an issue. For information about the Cherokee people today, see the official [Cherokee Nation](https://www.cherokee.org/) site.
